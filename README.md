# Shhh! Encrypted Chat

### This project was created as my personal project during Dev Academy. 

### See the deployed version here: <a>https://shhh-chat-app.heroku.com</a>

It is an encrypted chat application, and is the first (semi) complete React App I have made. The chat functionality is facilitated using Socket.io and the encryption functions come from the Crypto Node library. 

Authentication is handled using Authenticare, though the chat functionality doesn't currently require authentication as I haven't had time to finish it yet. 

I suggest you naviate to <a>https://shhh-chat-app.heroku.com/#/chat</a> if you want to play with the chat functionality.

Open the app in two browsers and encrypt your messages using a shared secret key.

Future development tasks:

- Implement DH public private key exchange rather than symetric secret key encryption.
- Finish Authentication Implementaiton.
